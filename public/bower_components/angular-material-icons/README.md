angular-material-icons
======================

AngularJS directive to use Material Design icons with custom fill-color and size.

This project encompasses all SVG icons from [Google's official Material Design Icon repository](https://github.com/google/material-design-icons) and few hand-picked icons from community-led [MaterialDesignIcons.com](http://materialdesignicons.com/) in form of angular directive that gives option to specify custom fill-color and size.

Changes to icon will go through delightful morphing if [SVG-Morpheus](https://github.com/alexk111/SVG-Morpheus) is also included in your application.
